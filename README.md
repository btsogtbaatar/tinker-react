# "Tinker" is a web application for handymen to find good-paying jobs.

Tinker is a platform that connects people with independent contractors, called Taskers, who can help with jobs, errands, and other tasks. For example: Yard work, Electrical help, Assistance with moving, etc. User should be able to register with their first name, last name, phone number, and email. Users should be able to sign in to the platform to create a new task. Users should be able to enter a category of task, detailed description, address, and date. The system can suggest nearby contract workers who are matched with the category of the task request for the user to select. Users can see the tasks they created before and can update and cancel their requests. Users should be able to see the price of contract workers and their availability.

Tinker also allows contractor workers to register themselves with the same registration information as a user, plus their specialization. The system should be able to send notifications if someone chooses a contract worker for their tasks. A contract worker should be able to accept and pass the task that is created for them.

If a task is completed, the user should be able to pay for a task with the system so that the contract worker can receive payment for the work.

The administrator should be able to see all lists of users, contract workers, and tasks.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
